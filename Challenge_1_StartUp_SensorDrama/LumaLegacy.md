## Luma Legacy: Smart Charm Jewelry for Millennials


You are interning for a start-up that is developing a wearable device that controls media content.

The end goal is to have the device interact with one's smart phone via bluetooth. But you don't have enough $$ to buy the parts.

In order to secure funding for the start-up, you must develop a functioning prototype to pitch to angel investors tonight. Your bluetooth parts are not in yet, but you have some basic electronics to start developing the system now. Your team needs a super basic demo for their pitch.


### What you have to work with:

* "bouncy" button

* LED's, resistors, arduino, jumper cables, breadboard


## Goal:

User's will press a button, to record a memo that will be uploaded to one's phone (bluetooth part). A light will illuminate when the recording is taking place and be dark when it's not recording.

Your users' will be doing all sorts of things to this button: pressing it long, pressing it hard, pressing it soft, moving their finger around while they are pressing it, rocking their finger back and forth.

You need a solid sign, to trigger the recording. You don't want to have multiple files for one recording.

Use custom functions, variables and parameters.
