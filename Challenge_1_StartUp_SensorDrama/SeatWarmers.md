## Seat Warmers: The New Responsive Furniture

You are interning for a start-up that is developing responsive seat cushions for perfect comfort while keeping warm at the Olympics.


The end goal is to have the device interact with one's smart phone via bluetooth. But you don't have enough $$ to buy the parts.


In order to secure funding for the start-up, you must develop a functioning prototype to pitch to angel investors tonight. Your bluetooth parts are not in yet, but you have some basic electronics to start developing the system now. Your team needs a super basic demo for their pitch.


### What you have to work with:

* FSR

* LED's, resistors, arduino, jumper cables, breadboard


## Goal:

When someone is completely on the seat, to start the warming mechanism.

When someone is shifting around on the seat, the warming mechanism cools for a few seconds.

Use an LED to stand for the heater. As it warms, pulse the LED in a breathe pattern. As it cools, the LED is a constant low illuminace level in short flashes.


Use custom functions, variables and parameters.
