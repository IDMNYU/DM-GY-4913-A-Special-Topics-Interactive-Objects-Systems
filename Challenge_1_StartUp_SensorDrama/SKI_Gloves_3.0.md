## SKI Gloves 3.0: Control your warmth


You are interning for a start-up that is developing a winter glove that controls boot warmers, sending text messages and your MP3 player.

The end goal is to have the device interact with one's smart phone via bluetooth. But you don't have enough $$ to buy the parts.


In order to secure funding for the start-up, you must develop a functioning prototype to pitch to angel investors tonight. Your bluetooth parts are not in yet, but you have some basic electronics to start developing the system now. Your team needs a super basic demo for their pitch.


### What you have to work with:


* Flex sensor

* LED's, resistors, arduino, jumper cables, breadboard


## Goal:

Users will be able to use one hand to be able to flip between modes: warming, messaging, tunes.

Closing the hand signals the warming mode.

Opening the hand signals the messaging mode.

A closed fist signals tunes mode.

User different colored LED's to stand in for the different modes.

Use custom functions, variables and parameters.
