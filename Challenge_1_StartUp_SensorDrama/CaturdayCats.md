##Caturday Cats from Amazon

You are interning for a start-up that is developing a chatty cat--a stuffed cat that interacts with kids.

In order to secure funding for the start-up, you must develop a functioning prototype to pitch to angel investors tonight. Your bluetooth parts are not in yet, but you have some basic electronics to start developing the system now. Your team needs a super basic demo for their pitch.

### What you have to work with:

* RangeFinder

* LED's, resistors, arduino, jumper cables, breadboard


## Goal:

When one comes near it, it meow's 3 times. After one goes away, it says "bye bye". When someone is super close, it purr's

Use a LED to stand in for the sounds that the cat makes. You could have different color LED's represent different behaviors. Or, you could program different LED behaviors to represent the different behaviors.

Use custom functions, variables and parameters.
