### Physical Computing Exercise

Create a patch that utilizes several inputs and/or several outputs with your Arduino. This could be several sensors which control your patch - change volume levels based on light levels, change opacity based on force, change color based on how far a flex sensor is bent, a push button switch to trigger a video/audio file to play. And/or, something happening in your patch (video playing, audio playing, someone moving in a space crosses a point) to trigger output (LED).

I'm looking to see you experiment and create interfaces with physical computing and Max.

Once you get the data in, using the Maxuino library (which utilizes the CNMAT externals), you need to manage that data to what it needs to control. You'll need to use timers, send + recieve objects.
