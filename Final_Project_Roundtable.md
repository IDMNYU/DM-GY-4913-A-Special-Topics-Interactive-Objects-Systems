## Final Project Roundtable

This assignment is one solely of design and communicating those designs with professionalism. You won’t be delivering these as a pitch to the class. But you will present these documents to your classmates and myself so that you may get feedback on how to proceed for your final project. As a result, it’s imperative to communicate your ideas as clearly as possible and with contextual research. The more clear your idea and direction, the more accurate your feedback (and thus final project).

Use the storyboard templates and illustrate 3 completely different ideas. Each idea must have the following: 

*	4 contextual links (minimum). These should show some combination of the interaction, technology and concept/theme/story. They could be from other artist’s/design projects, technologies, theory, mythology, story, news, event, etc.
*	Storyboard template showing the interaction, input and output, context, interface and cycle/process.
*	Demonstrate some change over time. How will your piece evolve or surprise me if I interact with it from 10 minutes straight?

### Requirements: 
*	3 ideas
*	required supporting information, which articulate the idea and the aspects it is concerned with.
*	Develop documents, drawings and a presentation
* 	Create a polished (meaning rehearsed, organized and clear) presentation video that is 3 minutes long. 1 minute per idea
*	upload all of your materials to your Process Site. Make sure that we can click on the images to see them larger. Ensure that the images are clear.


You have 2 weeks to complete this assignment. I expect to see the evidence of your effort in the thoroughness of your presentation, as well as your ideas. A suggestion to structure your time: 3 days to brainstorm and to develop 3 solid ideas (which aren’t just your first 3), 5 days to research, 3 days to develop the materials and the presentation, 1 day to record, 1 day to refine your recording.
