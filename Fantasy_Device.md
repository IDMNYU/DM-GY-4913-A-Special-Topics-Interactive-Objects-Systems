## Fantasy Device

Create a mock-up design for a fantasy device.  Use one of the storyboard templates provided to describe how this device looks and functions. This device can be simple or complex but should not be a simple add-on to an existing device. Think of the behaviors and capabilities that are needed. Be detailed. *Let your imagination run wild.* You will not have to make this device a reality.

This must be crafted and well considered in the execution of the presented materials.
