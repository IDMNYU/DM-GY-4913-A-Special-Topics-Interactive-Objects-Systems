## Final Project

The Final Project is the culmination of everything you have learned this semester. The overriding goal of this project is to create a tightly functioning physical system, that is responsive to input and varies it’s output overtime (aka. change over time). This can happen over networks, across devices, between platforms, the sky is the limit. It must be tightly functioning system that is reliable and diverse.

Option 1: Solve a Problem or Comment on a Problem

Perhaps it’s a communication problem, access issue, energy conservation or support, etc. (Botanicalls, Arduino and Silva, SWAMP, Tad Hirsh’s Complaint Coconuts Not Edible).

Option 2: Creative Expression

This could be anything. It’s up to you to develop. Popular possibilities might include being an instrument that interfaces with another program (ex Laetitia Sonami, Machina.cc) or creative mechanism (Sabrina Raaf, SWAMP, Benitez & Vogl). It could be a wearable (Hannah Perner-Wilson, Anouk Wipprecht, XS Labs) or even an installation (Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Tangible Interaction, YesYesNo). The choice is yours.


Whether the concept or the tech comes first, I’m not concerned with. BUT your idea must develop beyond either of these initial stages, to have more depth, connection and process to it. 

The Alpha stage of your project is due in 4 weeks. I will advice each of you on a case by case basis, what I expect you to achieve for the Alpha stage of your project.


Requirements: 
1.	Perfect circuit competence – appropriate resistors, electrical interfaces, wiring, colors, power supplies, sensors, etc
2.	Competent ORIGINAL code – commented out, utilization of serial print statements
3.	Your breadboard circuit schematic, created using Fritzing: http://fritzing.org/download/
4.	Documentation of the circuit in crisp, clear, framed, and well-lit shots as images.
5.	Create a short documentation video showing the input and output, as well as documenting the interaction and environment. Make sure the shots are appropriately lit throughout, clear and crisp. Make sure the subject fits the frame. Total duration no longer than 1 minute.
6.	Submit code, fritzing diagram, images and video in one compressed folder titled: FirstInitialLastName_Final_#.zip and turn it in through the Slack Assignments Channel
