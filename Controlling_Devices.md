## Controlling Devices

Use a transistor, relay or H-Bridge as an interface (along with other necessary supporting devices--voltage regulator, diode, sensor(s), additional power supplies, etc-- controlling output (dc motor, fairy lights, ac fan, etc). Control it based upon some sort of Arduino input through code. This control should be evident by a sensor (or two) control different output behaviors (beyond on and off). If you are using one sensor, you must program in a way to register a difference for the second output control (ie, press longer/shorter, after so much time passes, different light conditions, etc). Then, modulate/choreograph the output based upon input.

###Requirements: 

*	Perfect circuit competence – appropriate resistors, electrical interfaces, wiring, colors, power supplies
*	Use of an output interface (Transistor, Relay), Arduino and an input sensor or 2
*	Not only should the input control the output, but an input should modulate the output
*	Competent ORIGINAL code – commented out, utilization of serial print statements
*	Your breadboard circuit schematic, created using Fritzing: http://fritzing.org/download/
*	Documentation of the circuit in crisp, clear, framed, and well-lit shots as images.
*	Create a short documentation video showing the input and output, as well as documenting the interaction and environment. Make sure the shots are appropriately lit throughout, clear and crisp. Make sure the subject fits the frame. Total duration no longer than 30 seconds.
*	Submit code(github and Process site), fritzing diagram, images and video and a brief summary and reflection on your Process site.
