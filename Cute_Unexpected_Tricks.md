## Cute & Unexpected Tricks

Using the skills you have learned thus far in HCI, create a physical computing project using both input and output.  Your project should have at least 2 forms of output (not including the off state) based on 2 forms or levels of input.  This does not mean that you must activate multiple things based on multiple sensors.  Rather, that you are evaluating your input and adjusting your output as a result.  You can use multiple inputs and outputs if you like. 

Think of having different behaviors that occurs once in a while. Think of different blink patterns. Perhaps these are based on different types of input, or different durations of input.

Your project must respond to a physical action or series of actions a person takes, and it must be amusing, surprising, or otherwise engaging. It doesn't have to be practical, or complex, as long it shows that you understand the basics of digital and analog I/O and how to use them.  You could consider this a quick prototype for a much larger project, or a proof of concept.

Craftsmanship should have attention paid to it.  While this project may not have perfect craftsmanship, it should be well considered.

### Requirements:
*	Perfect circuit competence – appropriate resistors, electrical interfaces, wiring, colors, power supplies
*	A custom fabricated switch
*	Competent ORIGINAL code – commented out, utilization of serial print statements
*	3-4 Drawings/sketches of your project.  
*	Pseudo code for all of the code
*	Your breadboard circuit schematic, created using Fritzing: http://fritzing.org/download/
*	Documentation of the construction process and final, including the circuit in a PDF – 5-6 annotated images
*	Create a short documentation video showing the input and output, as well as documenting the interaction and environment. Make sure the shots are appropriately lit throughout, clear and crisp. Make sure the subject fits the frame. Total duration no longer than 1 minute.
*	Submit sketches, code (github and process site), fritzing diagram, images and video to your Process site along with a brief summary and reflection.
