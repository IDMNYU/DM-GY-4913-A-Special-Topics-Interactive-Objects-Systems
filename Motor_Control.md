## Motor Control

Using an H-Bridge and electrical components  (diode, sensor(s), additional power supplies, Arduino), create a physical computing circuit that controls the motor. This control should be evident by a sensor (or two) control different output behaviors (beyond on and off). If you are using one sensor, you must program in a way to register a difference for the second output control (ie, press longer/shorter, after so much time passes, different light conditions, etc). 

### Requirements: 
*	Perfect circuit competence – appropriate resistors, electrical interfaces, wiring, colors, power supplies, sensors, etc
*	Use of an output interface (Transistor, Relay), Arduino and an input sensor (or 2)
*	Competent ORIGINAL code – commented out, utilization of serial print statements
*	Your breadboard circuit schematic, created using Fritzing: http://fritzing.org/download/
*	Create a short documentation video showing the input and output, as well as documenting the interaction and environment. Make sure the shots are appropriately lit throughout, CLEAR and CRISP. Make sure the subject fits the frame. Total duration no longer than 30 seconds.
*	Submit code (github + Process site), fritzing diagram, images and video to your Process site with a brief reflection.
