## Fortune Telling Machine

Wire up your LCD, using your Shift Register to your Arduino. Using an external library and your own code, create your own Fortune Telling Machine. Your Fortune Telling Machine should have at least 4 different responses. Also include some method to take input. Use a method/sensor that you have not previously used. The Capacitance Sense Library is a fun one to explore. Or perhaps, create a new DIY Switch – such as a maze of tilt switches. The choice is yours. Explore timing and animation techniques for the text, especially across multiple screens. 

Consider the different types of input for one sensor. Can this variety effect a probability of outcomes? Work to achieve this within your code. Your code should show increasing sophisitication in generating rich outcomes. Is there an outcome that happens rarely? Semi-frequently? Etc, etc.

#### Requirements: 
*	Perfect circuit competence – appropriate resistors, electrical interfaces, wiring, colors, power supplies, sensors, etc
*	Use of the LCD and a shift register, Arduino and an input sensor.
*	Competent ORIGINAL code – commented out, utilization of serial print statements
*	Your breadboard circuit schematic, created using Fritzing: http://fritzing.org/download/
*	Documentation of the circuit in crisp, clear, framed, and well-lit shots as images.
*	Create a short documentation video showing the input and output, as well as documenting the interaction and environment. Make sure the shots are appropriately lit throughout, clear and crisp. Make sure the subject fits the frame. Total duration no longer than 1 minute.
*	Submit code (github and blog post reflection), fritzing diagram, images and video to your Process Site.
